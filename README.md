# LibreOffice Python UNO Examples

Examples for [ooouno](https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-ooouno) project.

Work in Progress... so please be kind...

[ooouno](https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-ooouno) project has made it possible to have a much more
user friendly way of programming for [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

The goal of this project is to have ever expanding practical examples for programming
using python in [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) in a truly [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) way.

At this time the example can be found in the [src/example](src/examples/).
As new example are create/submitted the example [src/example](src/examples/) folder will be expanded.

Another fantastic resource is [LibreOffice Programming](https://github.com/flywire/lo-p),
great documentation and many java examples.

Work in progress... more to come.
