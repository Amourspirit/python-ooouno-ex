# LibreOffice Conference 2021

This Example contains the examples used in the talk "Python scripts in LibreOffice Calc using the ScriptForge library" given by Rafael Lima during the LibreOffice Conference 2021. Original on [github](https://github.com/rafaelhlima/LibOCon_2021_SFCalc).

This example uses [types-scriptforge](https://pypi.org/project/types-scriptforge/) and [types-unopy](https://pypi.org/project/types-unopy/) give advantages of typing support and Intellisense support inside development environment. Adding type support to this example is the reason is has also been duplicated from the [original](https://github.com/rafaelhlima/LibOCon_2021_SFCalc).

To run the examples in the Python file you need to use LibreOffice >= `7.2`.

The [lib_o_con_2021.ods](./lib_o_con_2021.ods) is a working example.\
For the supporting files the res folder must be located in the same folder as [lib_o_con_2021.ods](./lib_o_con_2021.ods).
